### `whoami`

Just another soul who remembers the dial-up handshake and the glow of phosphor green text in dimly lit rooms. Back when knowledge wasn't locked behind paywalls, and #hack channels on IRC were buzzing with actual collaboration, not course advertisements. The landscape's changed, flooded with script-kiddie tutorials and overpriced "secrets."

**My philosophy? Simple:** Information *should* be free. Curiosity shouldn't cost you. If you're genuinely trying to learn, break things, understand systems â€“ ask. I'll share what I know, no strings attached. If I can't help, I'll point you towards someone who might. Gatekeepers aren't welcome here.

### `grep // skills`

Been spelunking in the digital trenches for a while. My toolkit includes, but isn't limited to:

* `Web Application Shenanigans`: Poking at HTTP/S, finding logic flaws, hunting XSS, SQLi, and the usual suspects. **(Primary focus on GitHub - it's a target-rich environment for learning!)**
* `RF/SDR Sorcery`: Listening to the airwaves, decoding signals, understanding protocols that don't use TCP/IP.
* `Software Archaeology`: Reversing binaries, debugging, understanding compiled mysteries.
* `Hardware Whispering`: Talking to silicon via JTAG/UART, dumping firmware, bending hardware to do unintended things.

Still learning, always probing. Complacency is the enemy.

### `netstat -an | grep LISTEN`

I keep a low profile. Most social media is just noise pollution contradicting the core tenets of privacy and security. You *can* find me occasionally, though:

* **[X (Twitter)]**: [@cyphernova1337](https://twitter.com/cyphernova1337) - *Low signal-to-noise ratio observed. Use DMs for direct contact.*
* **[Telegram Channel]**: [Join the Backchannel](https://t.me/+GAxaDS2xNOc0MTQx) - *Where actual discussion happens.*
